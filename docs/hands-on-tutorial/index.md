# Hands-On Tutorial

Learn to work with NetCDF climate datasets using a real mortality projection file from CIL research outputs.

## What you'll do

- Load and explore a NetCDF file using xarray
- Run analysis through a Slurm batch job
- Generate summary plots and statistics

## Dataset

**File**: Climate-driven mortality projections (NetCDF4 format)
**Location**: `/project/cil/home_dirs/rcc_onboard/data/mortality/montecarlo/`

NetCDF is one of the most common file formats used at CIL for storing multidimensional climate and impact data.

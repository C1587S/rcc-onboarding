# RCC Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the Climate Impact Lab predoc onboarding guide for working with RCC systems. This guide provides practical, hands‑on instructions for using multidimensional datasets and research workflows on the Research Computing Center infrastructure.

## Quick Start

**New to RCC?** Start with [Getting Started](getting-started/) to learn how to connect and submit your first jobs.  
**Ready to dive in?** Jump to the [Hands‑On Tutorial](hands-on-tutorial/) for a complete workflow example.

<!-- **Need reference materials?** Browse the [Reference](reference/) section for detailed documentation. -->

## What you'll learn

### Getting Started
Learn how to connect to RCC systems, start interactive sessions, and submit your first batch jobs using Slurm.

**→ [Connect to RCC](getting-started/)**

### Environment Setup  
Set up and manage Conda environments for reproducible research workflows using xarray, dask, and geopandas.

**→ [Setup Environments](environment-setup/conda-basics/)**

### Hands‑On Tutorial
Work through a complete example using mortality datasets, including data exploration, batch processing, and visualization.

**→ [Start Tutorial](hands-on-tutorial/)**

<!-- ### Reference Materials
Access detailed documentation on Slurm commands, data formats, and common code patterns for ongoing reference.

**→ [Browse Reference](reference/)** -->

!!! tip "CIL‑Specific Resources"
    This guide is tailored for Climate Impact Lab predocs working with the `cil` partition on RCC. Check current resource availability with:
    ```bash
    bash /project/cil/home_dirs/rcc_onboard/utils/monitor_partition.sh
    ```

# RCC Onboarding Guide

Welcome to the quick-start guide for working with the Research Computing Center (RCC) and the CIL research workflows. This guide is designed to help new users get up to speed with the RCC environment, access key datasets, and understand the core tools and workflows commonly used across CIL projects.

## Quick Start

- [Getting Started](getting-started/) to learn how to connect and submit your first jobs.

- [Hands-On Tutorial](hands-on-tutorial/) for a complete workflow example.

<!-- **Need reference materials?** Browse the [Reference](reference/) section for detailed documentation. -->

## What you'll learn

### Getting Started
Learn how to connect to RCC systems, start interactive sessions, and submit your first batch jobs using Slurm.

**→ [Connect to RCC](getting-started/)**

### Environment Setup  
Set up and manage Conda environments for reproducible research workflows using xarray, dask, and geopandas.

**→ [Setup Environments](environment-setup/conda-basics.md)**

### Hands-On Tutorial
Work through a complete example using mortality datasets, including data exploration, batch processing, and visualization.

**→ [Start Tutorial](hands-on-tutorial/)**

### Reference Materials
Access detailed documentation on Slurm commands, data formats, and common code patterns for ongoing reference.
